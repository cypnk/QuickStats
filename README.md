# QuickStats
A simple script to gather page statistics

This is a single JavaScript file to gather browsing information about a  
visitor for statistics and analytics purposes. It is not meant to  
replace more complex and comprehensive tools, and instead is meant to  
send simple page behavior in an easily processed form.

QuickStats checks for the Do Not Track setting (navigator.doNotTrack),  
please do not remove this check.
